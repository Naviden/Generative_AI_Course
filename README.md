## Introduction

The "Handbook of Generative AI" is a comprehensive guide that covers a wide range of topics in the field of generative artificial intelligence. The handbook is still a work in progress, and we are excited to share these preliminary materials with the community.

This repository complements the handbook by providing real-world examples and code snippets in Python, demonstrating the application of generative AI techniques across different domains.

## Getting Started

To get started with the examples in this repository, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/handbook-of-generative-ai-examples.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```sh
   cd handbook-of-generative-ai-examples
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
